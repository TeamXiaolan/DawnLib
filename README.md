# DawnLib

(was CodeRebirthLib)

DawnLib is a modern API for Lethal Company content and all sizes of mods. It contains:

- DawnLib API
  - Moons
  - Weathers
  - Interiors
  - Enemies
  - Items
  - Map Objects (Inside and Outside hazards)
  - Unlockables (Ship Upgrades and Furniture)
  - Additional Tile Sets (injecting more tilesets to interiors)

- DuskMod API
  - Ship Creation (In-progress)
  - Achievements
  - Entity Replacements (Enemy, Item, Unlockable and MapObject skin replacements)
  - Vehicles (Highly experimental)

- Some extra utilities
  - SmartAgentNavigator (completely intelligent NavMeshAgent navigator that uses PathfindingLib to performanently be able to use entrance teleports and fire exits reliably).
  - NetworkAudioSource
  - And more!

DawnLib also categorises (almost) everything in the game with keys, allowing for easy references to existing vanilla content.
If you'd like to support in the development of DawnLib, please consider reaching out to `@xuxiaolan` on discord, whether through the modding discord, github, or just
pinging on the lethal modding discord, we accept any sort of help, UI, Coders, Artists, etc.

**NOTE:** Enemies/Items/etc managed through DawnLib are likely **_unsupported_** by mods like CentralConfig or LethalQuantities.
This is because of the way DawnLib supports dynamically updating weights and therefore cannot be fixed from DawnLib.

## DawnLib (All C#)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="TeamXiaolan.DawnLib" Version="0.4.*" />

<!-- Optional Source Generation, mostly for when using the DuskMod API -->
<PackageReference Include="TeamXiaolan.DawnLib.SourceGen" Version="0.4.*" />
```

DawnLib is a hands-off way to register your content. The code to switch from LethalLib to DawnLib is very similar and will require minimal refactoring.
Most registration methods are under the `DawnLib` static class. When calling `DefineXXX` you are provided with a builder method that
explains most settings that you can configure.

Example:

```csharp
public static class MeltdownKeys {
  public static readonly NamespacedKey<DawnItemInfo> GeigerCounter = NamespacedKey<DawnItemInfo>.From("facility_meltdown", "geiger_counter");
}

// In your plugin
DawnLib.DefineItem(MeltdownKeys.GeigerCounter, assets.geigerCounterItemDef, builder => builder
  .DefineShop(shopBuilder => shopBuilder
    .OverrideCost(90)
    .OverrideInfoNode(assets.geigerCounterNode)
  )
);
```

`LethalContent` is an easy way to reference vanilla/modded content:

```csharp
EnemyType blobEnemyType = LethalContent.Enemies[EnemyKeys.Blob].EnemyType;
```

It should be noted that the vanilla references will not be in the registry until a while after the lobby is created.
In order to make sure everything is ready, you can listen to a registry's "freeze" event.
`OnFreeze` will only run once _ever_ (even between lobby reloads)

```csharp
LethalContent.Enemies.OnFreeze += () =>
{
  // All vanilla content is in and no more modded content can be added.
};

if (LethalContent.Enemies.IsFrozen)
{ // or check that the registry has already been frozen
  // ...
}
```

### PersistentDataContainer

`PersistentDataContainer` is an alternative to `ES3`. You can easily access save data with the `.GetPersistentDataContainer()` extension method, `.GetCurrentContract()` or `.GetCurrentSave()`

```csharp
void Awake() { // Plugin awake
    PersistentDataContainer myContainer = this.GetPersistentDataContainer(); // use this however you want, note that 'this' is required to use the extension method in the Awake function.
    
    // these only return null when not in-game. these also automatically handle resetting the save
    PersistentDataContainer? contract = DawnLib.GetCurrentContract(); // resets on: getting fired and save deletion.
    PersistentDataContainer? save = DawnLib.GetCurrentSave(); // resets on: ONLY save deletion.
}
```

Note: If you are going to make a large edit (calling `.Set`, `.GetOrSet`, etc multiple times) you should wrap it with `using(container.CreateEditContext())`. This delays saving data to the disk until all your edits have been completed.

## DuskMod (C# & Editor)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="TeamXiaolan.DawnLib" Version="0.4.*" />
<PackageReference Include="TeamXiaolan.DawnLib.DuskMod" Version="0.4.*" />

<!-- Optional Source Generation -->
<PackageReference Include="TeamXiaolan.DawnLib.SourceGen" Version="0.4.*" />
```

The DuskMod API is more opinionated, but automatically handles:

- Asset Bundle Loading
- Config Generation
- Skipping bundles when config is disabled
- Progressive Unlockables
- Automatically generate NamespacedKeys (C# Source Generators)
- **Registering content with no code!**

And finally, for any troubles in setting anything up, contact `@xuxiaolan` on discord or github for help.
