# TODO list

## Xu

- Dead body additions

less important:

- Add a special finished border for each achievement mod.
- Add a normal border for each achievement mod.

## Bongo

less important:

- Suits UI stuff for fitting em in.
- check over all visibility (public, internal, private)
- config stuff (NamespacedKey TOMLConverter, pretty print generics, look at patching to allow lists?)
- Create a "Terminal Store Catalogue" class that handles formatting to remove the need for the transpiler in TerminalPatches.cs
  - Would likely be a bit more incompatible with mods like TerminalFormatter in the beginning, but API should be open enough for them to adapt
- allow Dusk to set custom data
- DataContainer for lobby specific info? (things like gamemode settings, etc?)
- look at converting current info classes to be records
- NetworkDataContainer

## Needs to be done eventually
