# TODO list

## Needs to be done.

- Achievements not registering.
- Enemy bestiaries.
- Achievement reset button + reset in real time/update achievement progress in real time with UI.
- Progressive unlockable stuff not being copy pasted for unlocking scrap and/or unlockableitem
- NamespacedKey.Namespace not saving for rodrigo when he pulled from github, so EditorPrefs is per project not per github as it should be.
- Tag weights and more tags.
- MapObject CRInfo stuff?
- Weather Namespace shenanigans with CRLib created weathers.

## Needs to be done eventually.

- Suits
- ScanNode having preloader stuff to save its equivalent recttransform
- Swap TerminalPredicate stuff with preloader stuff.
- Switching CRInfo field reference to be an interface for ease of use
- Transpiler on spawning outside map object so that outside map objects count towards an internal int inside the SpawnOutsideHazards patch.
